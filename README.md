## About

A proof of concept, an experiment, but also my portfolio.

As I write this, AI has been the hot-topic for the last 2 years and is rapidly becoming ubiquitous. At first, I was rather skeptical about its abilities. What is it if nothing but a naive stochastic parrot? How can it ever become this tool that supposedly would revolutionize our world?

Well... to find out, I got a monthly subscription to Claude Code and decided to finally write this damn portfolio I told myself I would host almost 4 years ago.

## Motivations

I wanted to have my own personal space on the World Wide Web to showcase my skills, passion for IT, as well as my hobbies.

### Fully static ?

A fully static website seems like hell when one wants to add new content every now and then or make updates to their resume or contact information. I like the vanilla and simplistic approach and often go that route when possible, but let's be real, it was not realistic here.

### WordPress ?

WordPress is free ! But it is massive, clunky. You almost always have to add plugins which then add overhead. I don't want to work with PHP.

### Static site generator

SSGs is an approach that feels like the best of both world: no need to serve dynamic content but adding content is done with relative ease. Jekyll and Hugo are popular choices but, after reading about different solutions and scrolling more subreddits than I can recall, my mind was set on 11ty (eleventy) which seems like the more sensible choice for my needs. Time will tell if that was indeed the right call.
