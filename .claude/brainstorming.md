# Portfolio brainstorming

## Layout

The portfolio should have the following sections:

- Home page / About page
- Projects showcase
  - IT related
  - Hobbies
    - Photography
    - Music
- Contact form
- CV

The homepage should be visually striking, minimalistic, and provide a clear introduction to the client.

The projects showcase should be a simple page, listing in chronological order each project.
A project has a tag (pro, photo, music) to filter the list.
A project can have its own dedicated page.

## Styling

Use the "Less" CSS preprocessor.

Minimalist theme, orange and dark gray.
To be refined at a later stage.
